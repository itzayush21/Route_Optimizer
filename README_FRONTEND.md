# Route Optimizer - Mapbox Frontend

A web-based frontend for the Route Optimizer system that displays real-time traffic-aware vehicle routing using Mapbox maps.

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Mapbox Maps** - Visualize routes, customers, and support stations
- üö¶ **Real-Time Traffic Routing** - Routes optimized using current traffic conditions
- üöõ **Multi-Vehicle Support** - Handle multiple vehicles with different routes
- ‚õΩ **Support Stations** - Display nearby petrol stations and repair shops
- üìä **Route Metrics** - Show distance, time, and traffic-adjusted durations
- üí° **Smart Rerouting** - AI-powered route optimization with Gemini

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask and dependencies (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Mapbox account for map visualization

### 2. Quick Demo Setup

For testing the frontend without full database setup:

```bash
# Run the demo application
python demo_app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Mapbox Configuration

1. Sign up for a free Mapbox account at [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/)
2. Create an access token at [account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
3. Replace `YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE` in `static/app.js` with your actual token

### 4. Full Production Setup

For the complete system with database:

1. Configure your `.env` file with database and API credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual credentials
   ```

2. Set up required API keys:
   - Google Maps API key (for traffic data)
   - Gemini AI API key (for smart routing)
   - Supabase credentials (for authentication)

3. Run the full application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Demo Mode

1. **Login**: Use any email address (demo mode accepts any credentials)
2. **Optimize Routes**: Click "Optimize Routes" to generate a sample route
3. **Load Route**: Click "Load Latest Route" to display the demo route on the map
4. **Explore**: Click on markers to see details about customers, depot, and support stations

### Production Mode

1. **Authentication**: Login with valid Supabase credentials
2. **Set Parameters**: Configure number of vehicles, capacity, and preferences
3. **Optimize**: Click "Optimize Routes" to run real-time traffic-aware optimization
4. **Visualize**: View optimized routes with traffic conditions on the map

## Frontend Features

### Map Visualization

- **Depot** (üè≠): Red markers showing the warehouse/depot location
- **Customers** (üì¶): Teal markers for delivery locations
- **Route Lines**: Colored lines showing vehicle paths
- **Support Stations** (‚õΩüîß): Pink markers for petrol stations and repair shops

### Route Information

The sidebar displays:
- Vehicle assignments and metrics
- Distance and time calculations
- Traffic vs. normal duration comparisons
- Trip summaries with AI-generated insights

### Real-Time Features

- Traffic-adjusted route optimization
- Dynamic rerouting based on current conditions
- Support station recommendations
- Smart vehicle assignment

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with these backend endpoints:

- `POST /api/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/solve` - Route optimization with traffic data
- `GET /api/routes/latest` - Get the most recent route
- `GET /api/routes/{trip_id}` - Get specific route by ID

## Technical Details

### Frontend Stack

- **HTML5** with responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks for simplicity)
- **Mapbox GL JS** for interactive maps
- **CSS3** with modern styling

### Backend Integration

- **Flask** API server
- **CORS** enabled for frontend-backend communication
- **JSON** data exchange format
- **RESTful** API design

### Map Features

- Interactive navigation controls
- Responsive legend
- Popup information windows
- Dynamic marker styling
- Route line visualization

## Customization

### Styling

Edit the CSS in `static/index.html` to customize:
- Color schemes
- Layout and spacing
- Map controls
- Button styles

### Map Configuration

Modify `static/app.js` to change:
- Default map center and zoom
- Marker colors and icons
- Popup content
- Route line styling

### Demo Data

Update `demo_app.py` to change:
- Sample locations
- Route structures
- Metrics and timing
- Support station data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map doesn't load**: Check that your Mapbox token is valid and properly configured
2. **CORS errors**: Ensure Flask-CORS is installed and configured
3. **API connection**: Verify the backend server is running on port 5000
4. **No routes displayed**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by:
1. Opening browser developer tools (F12)
2. Checking the Console tab for error messages
3. Monitoring Network tab for API request/response data

## Contributing
